# jQuery UI Multiselect #

I've merged some of the pull requests from the original author's repo to make this plugin useable for me.

If you submit patches I'll try be a little more on top of maintaining them.

## History ##

### 8/9/2011 ###

* Merged code from NateEag to fix duplicate items - issues 90 & 91
* Merged code from chickenchan to fix issue with loosing sort order - issue 22
* Updated so width doesn't expand past what the target elements width is. Borders were causing this to happen.
* Add code to trigger the original select boxes change event whenever the list changes.

## Original Author's comments ##

This repository is no longer actively maintained by the author. However, pull requests are always welcome. If there's someone interested in officially maintaining the plugin, please let me know.
